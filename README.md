# CIS 1901 S24 Final Project. 

## Authors
Marissa Almonte and Tarunyaa Sivakumar 

## Project Proposal: C++ Chat Application
### Overview
Our project aims to develop a Wordle game using C++, providing a text-based interface for players to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts inspired by the NYT game. This application will incorporate templates for flexibility and using the Qt framework to implement a graphical user interface to increase our complexity. 


### Technical Specifications and Libraries
The Wordle game will leverage C++ templates for generic programming, allowing us to create flexible data structures and algorithms that can operate on various data types. This approach will enable us to handle different inputs and tiles in the game’s grid. 

For the graphical user interface, we will utilize the Qt framework. Qt's extensive library of widgets, layouts, and event handling mechanisms will enable us to design an interactive and visually appealing interface for our Wordle game.


### Structure and Features
The application will consist of a single-player Wordle game with a Qt-based GUI. The game mechanics will remain consistent with NYT’s Wordle gameplay, where the player attempts to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts.

Key features of the project include:

- A Game class utilizing templates for word storage and processing
- Qt widgets and layouts for displaying the game interface
- Event handling mechanisms to capture player input, process guesses, and update the GUI dynamically based on game progress


### Development Timeline and Collaboration
The project timeline is estimated to span approximately two weeks, with the initial phase focused on setting up the development environment, researching Qt framework since neither of us have worked with it before, and designing the data structures and template-based components. The second week will be dedicated to implementing core functionalities, including the Wordle game logic and Qt GUI elements. The final days will be allocated for testing, bug fixing, and refining the GUI layout and aesthetics.

Both members of the team will help with setting up the classes, data structures, and event handling functions. Marissa will take the lead on the GUI implementation with GUI. ​​Tarunyaa will take the lead on implementing the game logic.
